a simple board game by Java


The aim of your program is to simulate a simple Board Game commonly played among children, where the players take turn to roll a dice, and move their game tokens on a physical board. The winner is the one who reaches a final position on the board first. Your program will display a menu which allows the user of the program to select various options to simulate the various board game operations. As this is not a graphical program, you will show the players' "positions" by simply displaying numbers on the screen (eg. "Player David is on position 25", etc). The dice rolls will also be simulated by the program, which will update each player's position accordingly.
